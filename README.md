#Project Summarization

This project builds a multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system over Wikipedia that supports queries using text, images, or both. Wikipedia text and images are processed through a Spark ETL pipeline, embedded using a CLIP multimodal model, and stored in Milvus vector database for semantic retrieval. Retrieved content is then provided to a Small Language Model (SLM) to generate concise answers or summaries. The system can be further improved through finetuning with synthetically generated data.
